Writing code is one time job but maintaining code is life time job.
Hence when we write even small piece of code we MUST follow all best practices.

1. Coding standards.
2. Are there any bugs
3. Is there any duplication
4. Are we testing our code
5. Is my code open for any attack

Zensar - only if we follow all the best practice decided(Rules)

Is there any way by which this "static code analysis" be done automatically.
Ans: SONARQUBE
GUI will be shown.

SonarQube is static code analysis tool.


Sonarlint:
---------

It is plugin to eclipse IDE.
Helps developer analyse code. help developer to make better coding decision.
Shows report in eclipse.
It is quick and easy to check for bugs, code smells, vulnerability.

Bug: Coding mistake that can lead to unexpected behaviour.
Code smell: It is maintainability issue that makes your code confusing.
vulnerability: A point that open your code for attack.
